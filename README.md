<!-- About the Project-->
This is a landing page for a company offering SEO services. The HTML and CSS sheets were long and although thorough, not entirely easy to read for other web developers. 

This project was to test our newly learned skills from Module 1 and to get accustomed to creating organized HTML and CSS files.
